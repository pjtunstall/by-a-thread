# New plan for 2026

A snapshot will combine local player (position and velocity) with remote players (just position).

Player data will be sent from server to client by unreliable channel.

Changes in "status" (free (i.e. never joined), alive, dead, disconnected) will be sent as an enum cast to a `u8` by reliable channel.

Bullet collisions will be sent by unreliable channel and include position and velocity for clients to extrapolate from.
