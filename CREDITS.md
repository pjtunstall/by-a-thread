The wall images for Levels 1 and 4 are frescos from the Minoan palace at Knossos, Crete. The [griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos#/media/File:%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C_%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0._%D0%9C%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86._Knossos._Crete._Greece._%D0%98%D1%8E%D0%BB%D1%8C_2013_-_panoramio.jpg) (Level 0) is adapted from a photo by Vadim Indeikin, available under the Creative Commons [Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license. The [bull](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Knossos_bull_leaping_fresco.jpg) (Level 4) is from a photo by Gleb Simonov, Creative Commons [CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en).

The following wall images were generated by Google's Nano Banana AI: ants (Level 1), happy-monkeys (Level 2), squids (Level 5), ants-in-maze (Level 8), sad-monkeys (Level 7), and dolphins (Level 3). Squids and octopuses are a common motif on Minoan vases. The dolphins closely resemble a fresco from Knossos.
